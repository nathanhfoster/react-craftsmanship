// This module is just here for the exercise and doesn't actually do anything.
// In reality, what I would recommend for a function like this is that it keeps
// a queue of all updates and every 10 seconds it sends profile data to your
// server if there's any data in the queue.
// Then you presumably graph that data in Grafana or similar
let queue = []

// we're doing every 5 seconds so we don't have to wait forever...
// actual time may vary based on your app's needs
